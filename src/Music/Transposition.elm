{-|  Experimental Module for tune transposition

You can transpose a parsed ABC tune (in whatever key - perhaps in C) to (say) G# using:

    transposedResult = formatError (\_ -> "parse error") (parse source)
        `andThen` (\tune -> transposeTo ({pitchClass = G, accidental = Just Sharp, mode = Major},[]) tune)


The mode before and after transposition must be identical (that is: you cannot transpose minor to major and so on).
Chord symbols will be lost on transposition.

WARNING - NOT COMPLETE; NOT FULLY TESTED

{- A parse tree score contains implicit accidentals.  Very often, the source text will not mark them but assume that they
   are implicit in the key signature.  They also may appear 'locally' - i.e. earlier in the bar and thus inherited.
   In order for the transposition process to work, all accidentals must be made explicit during transposition and then 
   (perhaps) made implicit when written out to text.

   This means we have to thread state through the transposition and hence use folds rather than maps
